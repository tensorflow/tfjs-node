# TensorFlow.js Node.js bindings Windows troubleshooting.

The tfjs-node package uses the [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) package to handle cross-compiling the C++ code required to bind TensorFlow to Node.js. This cross platform solution can be somewhat tricky on Windows platforms. This guide helps reference solutions that have been triaged through Issues on the main [tfjs repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs).

## Ensure Python 2.x is installed

Currently, node-gyp requires Python 2.x to work properly. If Python 3.x is installed, you will see build failures. Also double check your python version `python --version` and update the Windows `$PATH` as needed.

## msbuild.exe Exceptions

Check the full stack trace from `npm install` (or `yarn`) command. If you see something like:

```
gyp ERR! stack Error: C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\bin\msbuild.exe failed with exit code: 1
```

You might need to install the system tools manually. This can be done via:

```
npm install --production windows-build-tools
```

If that still does not work - try re-running the command above in a privileged shell.
